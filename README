Linux re-port of a recent version.

I'm not related to the project, i just fixed the case sensetivity typos and unnecessary Windows headers. 
I also added a Cmake build, since there were only VS build files. Enjoy.

Compile:

$ cd cvblobslib
$ cmake .
$ make -jX 				# Where is is the number of cpu cores + 1

Install:

$ sudo make install		# To install into /usr/local/

Run example:

$ cd bin
$ ./blobTest

Include in your stuff:

#include <cvblobs/Blob.h>

Compile and Link in your stuff:

This is a example of a CMakeLists.txt to compile the Test with installed cvblobslib.

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)

FIND_PACKAGE( OpenCV REQUIRED )

add_executable(blobTest blobTest.cpp)

target_link_libraries(blobTest cvblobs ${OpenCV_LIBS})

If your cvblobslib is not installed in /usr/, you also can link it locally:
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -L/home/user/foo/cvblobslib/lib")
